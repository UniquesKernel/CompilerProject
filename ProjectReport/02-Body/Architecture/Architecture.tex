\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

On the topic of architecture, the \lang{} compiler is comprised of five primary
components: the \lexer, the \parser, the \static, the \codeGen{} and the \gcc. These
components form a pipeline, where the output of one component is the input of the
next; in tandem, they constitute the complete compilation process. \\

\lang{} is a strong statically typed language with a focus on memory safety. It's
explicit type system is designed to minimise confusion and obfuscation as each
variable must be explicitly declared with a type. It's memory safety is heavily
inspired by Rust, and is achieved through the use of a \borrowChecker{} which enforces
a subset of Rust's borrow checking rules. \\

To facilitate the \static{} and \codeGen{} components in way that is both efficient
and modular, the \lang{} compiler is written using a visitor pattern. This pattern
effiently enables the modification of the \ast{} without requiring extensive
modifications to the implementation of the \ast{} itself.
