\subsection{Parser}

The \lang{} \parser{} utilizes a \textit{bottom-up} parsing methodology.
Specifically, it is a \parserType{}(1)\footnote{Canonical Look-Ahead LR Parser with 1
symbol of lookahead} parser that is capable of parsing most deterministic
context-free grammars (CFG). \\

Given a grammar, the \parser{} synthesizes a parse table that is used to
determine what action to take based on the current state\footnote{The tokens
read so far} and the next token in the token stream. 

The \parser{} can take one of four actions: \textit{shift}, \textit{reduce},
\textit{accept}, or \textit{error}. 

\begin{itemize} 
  
  \item \textbf{Shift} - When the \parser{} reads a token that is not the last token
    in a production rule, it shifts. This means it places the current token on a
    stack, reads the next symbol, and transitions to the state specified by the parse
    table.

  \item \textbf{Reduce} - When the \parser{} reads a token that is the last token in
    a production rule, it reduces. This involves popping the symbols on the stack
    that correspond to the production rule, pushing the non-terminal symbol specified
    by the production rule onto the stack, and transitioning to the state specified
    by the parse table.

  \item \textbf{Accept} - The \parser{} enters this state when it has successfully
    parsed the entire token stream.

  \item \textbf{Error} - This state is entered when the \parser{} encounters an
    unexpected token that is not valid in any state reachable from the current state.

\end{itemize}

This means the \parser{} effectively becomes an automaton, cycling through states,
shifting and reducing, until it either accepts or errors. In this process it builds an
\ast{} that represents the structure of the program.
