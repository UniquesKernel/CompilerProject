\subsubsection{Type Checker}

The \typeChecker{} is responsible for the first phase of the \static. This involves
checking the \ast{} for type consistency. Using a visitor pattern and a bottom-up
approach, it verifies the type of each node in the \ast{} and ensures that the types
are consistent across the program. This is achieved by traversing the AST and
verifying that the expected type of each node is consistent with the type of its
children. \\

Once the \typeChecker{} verifies the consistency of a node, it annotates the node
with the expected type. This is done to facilitate the \codeGen{} component, which
uses the annotated type information to generate the correct intermediate
representation of the source code.
