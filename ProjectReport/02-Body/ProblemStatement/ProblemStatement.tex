\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:ProblemStatement}

\subsection{Background}

As of 2023, the top four most popular programming languages: Python, JavaScript,
TypeScript, and Java permit, to various degrees, a loose or optional type
system\cite{STACK}. This flexibility often results in ambiguities that may hinder the
readability and maintainability of code, as type deductions occur either at compile
time or runtime. With increasing complexities in software systems, there is an
emerging need for a language and compiler that enforce discipline and explicitness in
code, while offering robust control over system memory.

\subsection{Problem}

Developers currently can opt for dynamic or weak typing in popular programming
languages, which may compromise code readability and maintainability due to implicit
type deduction. This raises challenges in discerning the intentions of the developer
solely based on the source code. Moreover, these languages often utilize garbage
collectors, sacrificing control over system memory.

\subsection{Objectives}

To design and develop a custom programming language that mandates explicit typing for
all data structures and variables. To implement a compiler for the language that
performs zero type inference and provides clear error messages where ambiguities or
mistakes are detected. To achieve a balance between the explicitness of data types
and the conciseness of the language syntax, promoting readability. To offer precise
control over system memory while ensuring safety and avoiding the performance
drawbacks of garbage collection.
