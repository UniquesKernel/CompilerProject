\label{sec:Test}

Testing a compiler like the \lang{} compiler is a none trivial task to
accomplish. Ideally, one would have unit testing implemented for each process in the
compiler as well as integration tests between the different processes to ensure
to minimize and catch potential issues which critical for a compiler as it would
be impossible for a developer to debug their own code if they cannot trust the
behaviour of the language.
