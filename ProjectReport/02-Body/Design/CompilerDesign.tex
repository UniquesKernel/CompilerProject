\subsection{Compiler Design}
\label{sec:CompilerDesign}

On the topic of compiler design as both the \lexer{} and the \parser{}
are generated by thirdparty tools these will not be covered in any greater details
but a full table of the tokens and the production rules can be found in
appendix~\ref{sec:appA} and \ref{sec:appB}. To best understand the design of the
\static, its components the type checker, the borrow checker and also the code
generator it's requires understanding the visitor pattern as well as the
structure of the \ast{} of a typical \lang{} program.
