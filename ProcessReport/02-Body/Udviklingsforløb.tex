\section{Development process}
The development process has been agile in nature, with a weekly status meeting. The meeting cannot be characterised as stand-up, as it regularly took 2-3 hours, as the previous weeks work and the challenges we had met was discussed. At this meeting we also discussed what work would be next, and distributed it between us.
