\section{Meetings}
The preceding pages are filled with references to meetings, making this section largely redundant, but the closer structure bears describing, as meetings were the primary method of communication in the group. The group met every Monday morning, to discuss and review the preceding week and plan the coming week. Each member would explain what they had been working on, and how far they had come, as well as which challenges they had encountered. Any outstanding code reviews would also be done at this meeting. Once all the finished work was merged with the main branch, the roadmap was consulted, and the tasks for the next week was discussed and distributed.\\
The supervisor meeting was not too dissimilar. The group would start by describing what we had done since last supervisor meeting and how we planed on going forward. After this, the questions the supervisor had usually led to a discussion of some detail or problem that the group had either overlooked or not given enough thought. These discussions  sometimes took only 5-10 minutes, and sometime took up most of the hour allotted to the meeting.
