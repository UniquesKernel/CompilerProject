\section{Conflict management}
There were no conflicts in the group, and any disagreements were settled by discussion in the Monday meeting, or occasionally by "arbitration" at the supervisor meeting. "Arbitration" is an overstatement, as most, if not all, discussions was because we were uncertain what would be the best course of action, and not because we were convinced different courses was correct. As such we would ask our supervisor for his opinion, getting a fresh perspective, which always led to an agreement.\\
No disagreement was allowed to fester, as any decision was open to challenge, and the fact that we were only two group members meant that we both had to agree. No decision could be forced through against the will of a group member.
