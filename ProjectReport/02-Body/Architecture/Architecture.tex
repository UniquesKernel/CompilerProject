\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

The \lang{} compiler is comprised of five primary
components: the \lexer, the \parser, the \static, the \codeGen{} and the \gcc. These
components form a pipeline, where the output of one component is the input of the
next; in tandem, they constitute the complete compilation process. \\

Considering the findings of section~\ref{sec:TechAnalysis},
Figure~\ref{fig:CompilerProcess} shows a stripped down version of the \texttt{Rust}
compiler process, containing only the bare essentials required to meet the
requirements of section~\ref{sec:Requirements} and \ref{sec:Objectives}. The
following sections goes more details about each phase of the \lang{} compiler.
