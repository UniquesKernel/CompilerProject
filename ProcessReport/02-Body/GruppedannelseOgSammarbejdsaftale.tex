\section{Group formation and collaboration agreement}

The group was formed by a shared interest in creating a compiler for our bachelor
project. We have worked together before on both semester projects and on course
assignments, and knew that we worked well together.\\ Because we had worked together
before, no explicit agreement stating the terms of our collaboration was made, nor
was it needed. The implicit agreement to keep collaborating as we had done in the
past served well enough. There was an initial alignment of expectations, ensuring
that we both agreed that we wanted to make an effort to make a good project, and not
just make the "minimum viable product".
