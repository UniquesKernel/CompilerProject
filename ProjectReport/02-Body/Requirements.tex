\label{sec:Requirements}

To meet the objectives of section~\ref{sec:Objectives}, the compiler must meet
certain requirements as listed below.

\subsection{Language requirements} 

\begin{table}[ht]

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline
\rowcolor{gray!50}
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Requirements} \\
\hline
Must & The language must be Turing complete \\
     & The language must contain loops \\
     & The language must contain variables \\
     & The language must allow conditional code execution \\
     & The language must be able to do basic arithmetic \\
     & The language must contain functions \\
     & The language must be strongly and statically typed \\
     & The language must enable some form output\\
     & The language must support 64-bit Integer \\
     & The language must support 64-bit Floating point \\
     & The language must support 8-bit Character \\
     & The language must support Booleans \\
     & The language syntax must follow the language specification (see
     Appendix~\ref{sec:appB}) \\
\hline
Should & The language should have memory-management with a \texttt{Rust} inspired borrow checker \\
       & Variables should be immutable, unless explicitly made mutable \\
\hline
Could & Loops could be recursive functions \\
     & The language could allow a runtime input \\
     & The language could support runtime error handling \\
