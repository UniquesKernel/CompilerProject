\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

On the topic of architecture, the \lang{} compiler is comprised of four primary
components: the \lexer, the \parser, the \semantic, and the \codeGen. These
components form a pipeline, where the output of one component is the input of the
next; in tandem, they constitute the complete compilation process.
