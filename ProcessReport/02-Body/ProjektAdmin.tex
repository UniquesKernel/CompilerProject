\section{Project Administration}
The group used several tools to manage the project. The source code was subjected to source control using git on Github, where all changes to the main branch had to undergo a code review by the other group member before merging. We also used Githubs roadmap feature to make a roadmap and plan our project. We also created a Kanban board on Github, but it did not prove useful for us and thus saw no use.\\
The group communicated on discord, having created a dedicated server for the project. This provided a convenient place for both voice calls and text communications.
