\subsection{Lexer}

The \lexer{} processes the source code as a stream of characters. Once it identifies
a valid lexeme, it emits the corresponding token. Specifically, the \lexer{} follows
the maximal munch rule, recognizing the longest verified lexeme, ensuring that tokens
represent the most appropriate grouping of characters. In fine, the \lexer{}
transforms a stream of characters into a stream of tokens.

\lexerGen{} is a tool for generating \textit{lexers} or \textit{scanners} and is
often paired with \parserGen{} to produce compilers and interpreters. It's an
open-source project and is highly valued for its speed and efficiency in text
processing. \\

The use of \lexerGen{} for the \lang{} project streamlines the process of lexical
analysis and makes it simple to create or alter the definition of lexemes. Its
compatibility with \parserGen{} ensures seamless integration between the \lexer{} and
\parser{}. Just as with Bison, the choice of \lexerGen{} is reinforced by its
comprehensive documentation, active community support, and its proven track record in
various software projects. This makes it a reliable and robust choice for the lexical
analysis phase of the \lang{} compiler.
