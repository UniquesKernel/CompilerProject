\label{sec:design}

The design of the \lang{} compiler consists of two separate designs. The language
design and the compiler design. The language design is focused on the grammatical
structure of \lang{} where the compiler design focuses on the compiler and the design
of a software system capable of parsing the language as specified in the language
design.
