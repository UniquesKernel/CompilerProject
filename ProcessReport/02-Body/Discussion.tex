\section{Discussion}
Being in a two man group made a lot of the development process quite fluid, as any issue could easily be addressed via conversations. Agreements did not have to be disseminated to absent group members, as both members necessarily had to be present to reach an agreement. Unilateral decisions could of course be taken, and would be explained and open for challenge at the weekly group meetings. Our approach to planing, finding the minimal viable product (or extension of the product), combined with the iterative nature of the weekly meeting-work cycles allowed us to be flexible and meet challenges in the manner most suited to the situation.\\ 
While our process has served us well, the fact that we were only two members of the group allowed for certain liberties, which would be disastrous had the group been larger, or less familiar. The requirement for complete agreement before a decision could be taken, the complete lack of any leadership structure, or indeed any formalised structure at all, was no hindrance, but could have significantly hampered a larger group.
