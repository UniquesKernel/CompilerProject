\subsection{Code Generator}
\label{sec:codeGeneratorDesign}
Transforming the AST into executable code is the task of the \codeGen. As it works on the AST, it is designed to use the visitor pattern. We decided early in the process that the code generation should use the LLVM package.\footnote{https://llvm.org} As such the design of the code generation conforms to the requirements of LLVM. Set-up of the LLVM environment is handled in the constructor of the code generator visitor.\\
As described in section \ref{sec:LLVM}, the code generation creates an object (.o) file. This can then be compiled with GCC or any other C compiler. Because of this, we don't create an entry point. This is in part because GCC does it for us, but also to allow \lang{} to be used to create functions for other programs.
