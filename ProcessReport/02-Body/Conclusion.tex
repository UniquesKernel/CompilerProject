\section{Conclusion}
The development process has been a lose form of agile, allowing for a flexible approach to development. The group being small and the members having worked together in the past, and thus knowing each other, allowed us to dispense with formal management structures and collaboration agreements. This lack of formal structure allowed the group to react easily to changing circumstances and new knowledge.
