\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:Implementation}

As the \lexer{} and \parser{} are both generated by \lexerGen{} and \parserGen{}
these won't be covered in any details as a full list of their specified
tokens, regular expressions and production rules can be found in Appendix
\ref{sec:appA} and \ref{sec:appB}. The following sections goes into details about
the implementation of the three visitors: the \typeChecker{},
the \borrowChecker{}, and the \codeGen{} based on their
designs as described in section~\ref{sec:design}.
