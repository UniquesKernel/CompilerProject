\subsection{Borrow Checker}
\label{sec:BorrowCheckerImpl}

The \borrowChecker{} implements a the visitor pattern, as described in
section~\ref{sec:VisitorDesign}, and uses two tables a
\texttt{symbolTable} and a \texttt{referenceTable} to keep track of variables as well
as keeping track of references, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:BorrowCheckerDesign}. the \borrowChecker then uses these tables to enforce the
same ownership, borrowing and reference rules as the rust language as described
in Section~\ref{sec:LanguageDesign} and Section~\ref{sec:BorrowCheckerDesign}. 

\subsubsection{Implementation status}

The implementation of the \borrowChecker{} is quite difficult and its current state
does not yet support all features in \lang{}. 

The \borrowChecker{} does a good job tracking ownership and references within
functions, even across scopes. It it able to accurately track ownership and
references across internal scopes\footnote{None function call related changes in
scope, e.g. nested if-else statements and code blocks.} but once a variable is parsed
to a function as an argument the current implementation of the \borrowChecker{} has
difficulties keeping track of ownerships, in cases were the ownership of the
variables need to change, or references in cases were references are parsed as
arguments to a functions.

This causes tests to fail see section~\ref{sec:tests}.
