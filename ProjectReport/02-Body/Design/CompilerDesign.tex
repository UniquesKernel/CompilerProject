\subsection{Compiler Design}
\label{sec:CompilerDesign}

As both the \lexer{} and the \parser{} are generated by third party tools, these will
not be covered, but a full table of the tokens and the
production rules can be found in appendix~\ref{sec:appA} and \ref{sec:appB}. To best
understand the design of the \static, its components: the type checker and the borrow
checker, as well as the \codeGen{}, requires an understanding of
the visitor pattern, as well as the structure of the \ast{} of a typical \lang{}
program.
