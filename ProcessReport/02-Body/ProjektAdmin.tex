\section{Project Administration} 

The group used several tools to manage the project. The source code was subjected to
source control using git on Github, where all changes to the main branch had to
undergo a code review by the other group member before merging. We also used Githubs
roadmap feature to make a roadmap and plan our project. \\

Github Actions where a particularly useful tool to ensure a uniform build environment
for the project. In fact before a merge to the main branch was possible this build
had to succeed without problems. 
In combination with branch protect and code reviews these tools helped ensure that the
main branch always hosted the project in a state that both group members agree on. \\

The group communicated on discord, having created a dedicated server
for the project. This provided a convenient place for both voice calls and text
communications.
