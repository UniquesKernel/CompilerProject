\section{Work distribution}
The work distribution took place on the weekly Monday meetings where the roadmap was
consulted and modifications to it discussed. Once the next tasks were decided, we
would distribute them between us, on a voluntary basis. There was at no point any
difficulty in getting the necessary tasks distributed, as we had agreed, in our
implicit collaboration agreement, to do what needed to be done. It was at any point
possible to contest the relevance of a task, and some tasks were discarded after
thorough discussion, when we agreed that it would take too long, or would not help
with our problem statement.
