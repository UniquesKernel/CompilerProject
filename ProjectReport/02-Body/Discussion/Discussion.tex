\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:Discussion}

The development of a programming language and compiler is inherently an iterative
task, with opportunities for continual optimization and improvement. As is typical in
software development, each iteration addresses existing bugs while potentially
introducing new ones. \\

In this context, and considering the project's outcomes in relation to the
pre-established objectives detailed in section~\ref{sec:Objectives}, this section
aims to summarize the achievements of the project. Specifically, it examines the
development of a custom programming language and compiler, designed for type safety
and memory safety without the use of a garbage collector. \\
