\subsection{Borrow Checker}

The \borrowChecker{} is responsible for the second phase of the \static. 
This involves overall structure of the \ast{} to ensure that the program
adheres a subset of the same rules that is implemented in the Rust programming
language\cite{RUST}. \\

The rules are as follows:

\begin{enumerate} 
  \item Each value must have only a single owner \footnote{An owner is a variable, so
    each value can only belong to a single variable.}. 
  
  \item Each variable must be initialized before use. 

  \item Each variable can have unlimited immutable references\footnote{A reference is
    a pointer that automatically is cleaned up when it goes out of scope.}.

  \item Each variable can have only one mutable reference at any one time. 

  \item Mutable and immutable references cannot co-exist. 

  \item References cannot outlive the variable they are referencing.
\end{enumerate}

When enforced together with automatic memory cleanup, these rules ensure the memory
safety of the program.
