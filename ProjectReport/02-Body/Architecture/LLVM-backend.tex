\subsection{Code Generator and the \gcc{}}
\label{sec:LLVM}

The \codeGen{} for the \lang{} compiler is responsible for traversing the
\ast{} and translating each node into its corresponding low-level
instructions. This process involves meticulously converting the structured,
high-level representations of the \ast{} into a series of machine-level commands.
Following this, the \codeGen{} outputs this low-level code into an object file.
This file, while containing executable code, is not yet in a form that can be
directly run on a computer. \\

At this juncture, the \gcc{} plays a vital role. It
takes the object file produced by our Code Generator and performs the necessary
linking with other object files. This step is essential for resolving external
references and integrating various code modules into a cohesive whole. After linking,
the \gcc{} embarks on translating the aggregated object code into an executable file. \\

This use of the \gcc{} offers three distinct advantages: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{Optimization:}] The \gcc{} is capable of very sophisitcated
    optimizations on our low-level code.
  \item[\textbf{Target Specific Compilation:}] The \gcc{} is capable of generating code
    for a wide target of hardware architectures allowing \lang{} code to run on must
    platoforms and architectures.
  \item[\textbf{Integration with C/C++:}] C/C++ also make use of the \gcc{} and
    object files. By forwarding function declaration in C/C++, functions written in
    \lang{} can be forward declared and called inside C/C++ code bases. This allows
    users to take theoretically take advantage of \lang{}'s memory and concurrency
    safety\footnote{This is has been observed and excuted for simple programs but
    not tested in full}.
\end{itemize}
